  A Cost Mode Registry for the Application-Layer Traffic Optimization
                            (ALTO) Protocol
                      draft-ietf-alto-cost-mode-02

Abstract

   This document creates a new IANA registry for tracking cost modes
   supported by the Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO)
   protocol.  Also, this document relaxes a constraint that was imposed
   by the ALTO specification on allowed cost mode values.

   This document updates RFC 7285.

1.  Introduction

   The cost mode attribute indicates how costs should be interpreted
   when communicated in the Application-Layer Traffic Optimization
   (ALTO) protocol [RFC7285].  The base ALTO specification includes a
   provision for only two modes:

   "numerical":  Indicates that numerical operations can be performed
      (e.g., normalization) on the returned costs (Section 6.1.2.1 of
      [RFC7285]).

   "ordinal":  Indicates that the cost values in a cost map represent
      ranking (relative to all other values in a cost map), not actual
      costs (Section 6.1.2.2 of [RFC7285]).

   Additional cost modes are required for specific ALTO deployment cases
   (e.g., [I-D.ietf-alto-path-vector]).  In order to allow for such use
   cases, this document relaxes the constraint imposed by the base ALTO
   specification on allowed cost modes (Section 3) and creates a new
   ALTO registry to track new cost modes (Section 4).

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119][RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document makes use of the terms defined in [RFC7285].

3.  Updates to RFC7285


3.1.  Updates to Section 6.1.2 of RFC7285

   This document updates Section 6.1.2 of [RFC7285] as follows:

   OLD:

      The cost mode attribute indicates how costs should be interpreted.
      Specifically, the cost mode attribute indicates whether returned
      costs should be interpreted as numerical values or ordinal
      rankings.

      It is important to communicate such information to ALTO clients,
      as certain operations may not be valid on certain costs returned
      by an ALTO server.  For example, it is possible for an ALTO server
      to return a set of IP addresses with costs indicating a ranking of
      the IP addresses.  Arithmetic operations that would make sense for
      numerical values, do not make sense for ordinal rankings.  ALTO
      clients may handle such costs differently.

      Cost modes are indicated in protocol messages as strings.

   NEW:

      The cost mode attribute indicates how costs should be interpreted.
      This document defines two cost modes (numerical values and ordinal
      rankings), but additional cost modes can be defined in the future.

      It is important to communicate such information to ALTO clients,
      as certain operations may not be valid on certain costs returned
      by an ALTO server.  For example, it is possible for an ALTO server
      to return a set of IP addresses with costs indicating a ranking of
      the IP addresses.  Arithmetic operations that would make sense for
      numerical values, do not make sense for ordinal rankings.  ALTO
      clients may handle such costs differently.

      Cost modes are indicated in protocol messages as strings.

      Future documents that define a new cost mode SHOULD indicate
      whether that new cost mode applies to all or a subset of cost
      metrics.  If not explicitly indicated, the new cost mode applies
      to all cost metrics.


3.2.  Updates to Section 10.5 of RFC7285

   This document updates Section 10.5 of [RFC7285] as follows:

   OLD:

      A cost mode is encoded as a string.  The string MUST have a value
      of either "numerical" or "ordinal".

   NEW:

      A cost mode is encoded as a string.  The string MUST be no more
      than 32 characters, and it MUST NOT contain characters other than
      US-ASCII alphanumeric characters (U+0030-U+0039, U+0041-U+005A,
      and U+0061-U+007A), the hyphen-minus ('-', U+002D), the colon
      (':', U+003A), or the low line ('_', U+005F).  Cost modes reserved
      for Private Use are prefixed with "priv:" (Section 4).  Otherwise,
      the cost mode MUST have a value that is listed in the registry
      created in Section 4 of RFCXXXX.

   *  Note to the RFC Editor: Please replace RFCXXXX with the RFC number
      to be assigned to this document.


4.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests IANA to create a new subregistry entitled
   "ALTO Cost Modes" under the "Application-Layer Traffic Optimization
   (ALTO) Protocol" registry available at [ALTO].

   The registry is initially populated with the following values:

   +------------+-----------------------------+--------------------+

   The assignment policy for this registry is "IETF Review" (Section 4.8
   of [RFC8126]).

   Cost modes prefixed with "priv:" are reserved for Private Use
   (Section 4.1 of [RFC8126]).

5.  Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce new concerns other than those
   already discussed in Section 15 of [RFC7285].
