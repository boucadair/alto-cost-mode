      Also, this document relaxes a constraint that was imposed by the ALTO
      specification on allowed cost mode values.</t>

    <section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">
      <t>The cost mode attribute indicates how costs should be interpreted
      when communicated in the Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO)
      Protocol <xref target="RFC7285"></xref>. The base ALTO specification
      includes a provision for only two modes: <list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="&quot;numerical&quot;:">Indicates that numerical
          operations can be performed (e.g., normalization) on the returned
          costs (Section 6.1.2.1 of <xref target="RFC7285"></xref>).</t>

          <t hangText="&quot;ordinal&quot;:">Indicates that the cost values in
          a cost map represent ranking (relative to all other values in a cost
          map), not actual costs (Section 6.1.2.2 of <xref
          target="RFC7285"></xref>).</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>Additional cost modes are required for specific ALTO deployment cases
      (e.g., <xref target="I-D.ietf-alto-path-vector"></xref>). In order to
      allow for such use cases, this document relaxes the constraint imposed
      by the base ALTO specification on allowed cost modes (<xref
      target="anupdate"></xref>) and creates a new ALTO registry to track new
      cost modes (<xref target="IANA"></xref>).</t>

      <section title="Updates to Section 6.1.2 of RFC7285">
        <t>This document updates Section 6.1.2 of <xref
        target="RFC7285"></xref> as follows:</t>

        <t>OLD:<list style="empty">
            <t>The cost mode attribute indicates how costs should be
            interpreted. Specifically, the cost mode attribute indicates
            whether returned costs should be interpreted as numerical values
            or ordinal rankings.</t>

            <t>It is important to communicate such information to ALTO
            clients, as certain operations may not be valid on certain costs
            returned by an ALTO server. For example, it is possible for an
            ALTO server to return a set of IP addresses with costs indicating
            a ranking of the IP addresses. Arithmetic operations that would
            make sense for numerical values, do not make sense for ordinal
            rankings. ALTO clients may handle such costs differently.</t>

            <t>Cost modes are indicated in protocol messages as strings.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>NEW:<list style="empty">
            <t>The cost mode attribute indicates how costs should be
            interpreted. This document defines two cost modes (numerical
            values and ordinal rankings), but additional cost modes can be
            defined in the future.</t>

            <t>It is important to communicate such information to ALTO
            clients, as certain operations may not be valid on certain costs
            returned by an ALTO server. For example, it is possible for an
            ALTO server to return a set of IP addresses with costs indicating
            a ranking of the IP addresses. Arithmetic operations that would
            make sense for numerical values, do not make sense for ordinal
            rankings. ALTO clients may handle such costs differently.</t>

            <t>Cost modes are indicated in protocol messages as strings.</t>

            <t>Future documents that define a new cost mode SHOULD indicate
            whether that new cost mode applies to all or a subset of cost
            metrics. If not explicitly indicated, the new cost mode applies to
            all cost metrics.</t>

      <section title="Updates to Section 10.5 of RFC7285">
        <t>This document updates Section 10.5 of <xref
        target="RFC7285"></xref> as follows:</t>

        <t>OLD:<list style="empty">
            <t>A cost mode is encoded as a string. The string MUST have a
            value of either "numerical" or "ordinal".</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>NEW:<list style="empty">
            <t>A cost mode is encoded as a string. The string MUST be no more
            than 32 characters, and it MUST NOT contain characters other than
            US-ASCII alphanumeric characters (U+0030-U+0039, U+0041-U+005A,
            and U+0061-U+007A), the hyphen-minus ('-', U+002D), the colon
            (':', U+003A), or the low line ('_', U+005F). Cost modes reserved
            for Private Use are prefixed with "priv:" (<xref
            target="IANA"></xref>). Otherwise, the cost mode MUST have a value
            that is listed in the registry created in <xref
            target="IANA"></xref> of RFCXXXX.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t></t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Backward Compatibility Considerations">
      <t>ALTO servers that support new code modes for specific cost metrics
      will use the mechanism specified in Section 9.2 of <xref
      target="RFC7285"></xref> to advertise their capabilities. ALTO clients
      (including legacy) use that information to specify cost constraints in
      their requests (e.g., indicate a cost metric and a cost mode). An
      example of such a behavior is depicted in Section 9.2.3 of <xref
      target="RFC7285"></xref>.</t>

      <t>If an ALTO client includes a cost mode that is not supported by an
      ALTO server, the server indicates such an error with the error code
      E_INVALID_FIELD_VALUE as per Section 8.5.2 of <xref
      target="RFC7285"></xref>. In practice, legacy ALTO servers will reply
      with the error code E_INVALID_FIELD_VALUE to any request that includes a
      cost type other than "numerical" or "ordinal" for the "routingcost" cost
      metric. </t>
